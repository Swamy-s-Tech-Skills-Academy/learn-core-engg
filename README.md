I am learning Core Engineering Skills from different Video Courses, Books, and Websites.

## **🚀 Optimized Folder Structure for Algorithm Learning**

Since you're solving problems across multiple languages and want a **scalable, structured, and easy-to-navigate repository**, let's design a **hierarchical folder structure** that supports:

- **Pattern-based learning** (solving problems by recognizing patterns)
- **Multi-language support** (C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, Python, TypeScript)
- **Future expansion** (adding system design, API design, and OOD concepts later)

---

## **📁 Recommended Folder Structure**

```text
/learn-core-engg
  ├── algos           ← All algorithm learning materials
  ├── system-design   ← Dedicated to system design concepts, case studies, and exercises
  ├── ood             ← Object-oriented design principles and projects
  ├── api-design      ← API design principles and examples
  └── README.md       ← Overview and instructions
```

## algos folder structure

```text
algos
  ├── patterns
  │     ├── 01-two-pointers
  │     ├── 02-sliding-window
  │     └── ...
  ├── problems
  │     ├── easy
  │     ├── medium
  │     └── hard
  └── solutions
        ├── CSharp
        ├── Go
        ├── Java
        ├── JavaScript
        ├── Python
        └── TypeScript
```

### **📌 Folder Details**

#### **1️⃣ `/patterns` → Algorithmic Patterns**

- Each pattern folder (`01-two-pointers`, `02-sliding-window`, etc.) contains problems categorized under that pattern.
- Inside each pattern folder, we can have:

  ```text
  /01-two-pointers
    |-- problem1.md
    |-- problem2.md
    |-- solutions/
        |-- CSharp/
        |-- Go/
        |-- Java/
        |-- JavaScript/
        |-- Python/
        |-- TypeScript/
  ```

#### **2️⃣ `/problems` → LeetCode-style problems sorted by difficulty**

- Separate folders for **Easy, Medium, Hard** problems.
- Each folder contains problem statements in markdown (`.md`) format.

#### **3️⃣ `/solutions` → Language-Specific Solutions**

- A dedicated folder for each language to store problem solutions.

#### **4️⃣ `/system-design`, `/ood`, `/api-design` (For Later)**

- These will house **system design**, **object-oriented design**, and **API design** concepts once you progress beyond algorithms.

### **✅ Benefits of This Structure**

✔ **Scalability** – New patterns, problems, or languages can be added easily.  
✔ **Clarity** – Pattern-based learning makes it easier to **recognize problem similarities**.  
✔ **Multi-language support** – Keeps solutions organized by language.  
✔ **Easy Navigation** – Directories are **intuitive** and **structured**.

### **🔥 Next Steps**

1️⃣ **Do you like this structure, or would you like any modifications?**  
2️⃣ **Which pattern do you want to start with first?** (I suggest **Two Pointers** or **Sliding Window**).

Let’s set up your repository and start solving problems 🚀!
