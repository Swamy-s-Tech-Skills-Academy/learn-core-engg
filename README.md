## **üöÄ Optimized Folder Structure for Algorithm Learning**

Since you're solving problems across multiple languages and want a **scalable, structured, and easy-to-navigate repository**, let's design a **hierarchical folder structure** that supports:

- **Pattern-based learning** (solving problems by recognizing patterns)
- **Multi-language support** (C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, Python, TypeScript)
- **Future expansion** (adding system design, API design, and OOD concepts later)

## **üìÅ Recommended Folder Structure**

```text
/learn-algos                # Root directory for algorithm learning
  |-- /patterns             # Core algorithmic patterns
  |    |-- /01-two-pointers
  |    |-- /02-sliding-window
  |    |-- /03-fast-slow-pointers
  |    |-- /04-merge-intervals
  |    |-- /05-cyclic-sort
  |    |-- /06-top-k-elements
  |    |-- /07-subsets
  |    |-- /08-binary-search
  |    |-- /09-bit-manipulation
  |    |-- /10-trees-dfs-bfs
  |    |-- /11-graphs
  |    |-- /12-dynamic-programming
  |    |-- /13-trie
  |    |-- /14-greedy
  |
  |-- /problems             # LeetCode-style problems
  |    |-- /easy
  |    |-- /medium
  |    |-- /hard
  |
  |-- /solutions            # Your personal solved problems
  |    |-- /CSharp
  |    |-- /Go
  |    |-- /Java
  |    |-- /JavaScript
  |    |-- /Python
  |    |-- /TypeScript
  |
  |-- /system-design        # System design concepts (later phase)
  |-- /ood                  # Object-oriented design concepts (later phase)
  |-- /api-design           # API design principles (later phase)
  |-- README.md             # Overview of repository
```

### **üìå Folder Details**

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ `/patterns` ‚Üí Algorithmic Patterns**

- Each pattern folder (`01-two-pointers`, `02-sliding-window`, etc.) contains problems categorized under that pattern.
- Inside each pattern folder, we can have:

  ```text
  /01-two-pointers
    |-- problem1.md
    |-- problem2.md
    |-- solutions/
        |-- CSharp/
        |-- Go/
        |-- Java/
        |-- JavaScript/
        |-- Python/
        |-- TypeScript/
  ```

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ `/problems` ‚Üí LeetCode-style problems sorted by difficulty**

- Separate folders for **Easy, Medium, Hard** problems.
- Each folder contains problem statements in markdown (`.md`) format.

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ `/solutions` ‚Üí Language-Specific Solutions**

- A dedicated folder for each language to store problem solutions.

#### **4Ô∏è‚É£ `/system-design`, `/ood`, `/api-design` (For Later)**

- These will house **system design**, **object-oriented design**, and **API design** concepts once you progress beyond algorithms.

### **‚úÖ Benefits of This Structure**

‚úî **Scalability** ‚Äì New patterns, problems, or languages can be added easily.  
‚úî **Clarity** ‚Äì Pattern-based learning makes it easier to **recognize problem similarities**.  
‚úî **Multi-language support** ‚Äì Keeps solutions organized by language.  
‚úî **Easy Navigation** ‚Äì Directories are **intuitive** and **structured**.
