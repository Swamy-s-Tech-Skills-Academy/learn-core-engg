# Two Pointers

This folder contains implementations of algorithms using the Two Pointers technique. Below are the algorithms included and instructions to run them.

## Algorithms

### 1. Valid Palindrome
Checks if a given string is a valid palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

### 2. Three Sum
Finds all unique triplets in an array that sum up to zero.

### 3. Remove Nth Node from End of List
Removes the nth node from the end of a linked list in a single pass.

## Setup

1. Initialize the project:
   ```powershell
   npm init -y
   ```

2. Install Jest for testing:
   ```powershell
   npm install --save-dev jest
   ```

## Running the Code

To run the main demonstration file:
```powershell
node main.js
```

## Running Tests

To run the tests:
```powershell
npm test
```
