### Dry Run of Failing Test Case

#### Input
```
"aq)xy())qf(a(ba)q)"
```

#### Steps
1. Initialize `stack = []` and `s_list = ['a', 'q', ')', 'x', 'y', '(', ')', ')', 'q', 'f', '(', 'a', '(', 'b', 'a', ')', 'q', ')']`.
2. Traverse the string:
   - At index 0, character is 'a'. Not a parenthesis, continue.
   - At index 1, character is 'q'. Not a parenthesis, continue.
   - At index 2, character is ')'. Stack is empty, push `[')', 2]`.
   - At index 3, character is 'x'. Not a parenthesis, continue.
   - At index 4, character is 'y'. Not a parenthesis, continue.
   - At index 5, character is '('. Push `['(', 5]`.
   - At index 6, character is ')'. Top of stack is `['(', 5]`, pop it.
   - At index 7, character is ')'. Stack is empty, push `[')', 7]`.
   - At index 8, character is 'q'. Not a parenthesis, continue.
   - At index 9, character is 'f'. Not a parenthesis, continue.
   - At index 10, character is '('. Push `['(', 10]`.
   - At index 11, character is 'a'. Not a parenthesis, continue.
   - At index 12, character is '('. Push `['(', 12]`.
   - At index 13, character is 'b'. Not a parenthesis, continue.
   - At index 14, character is 'a'. Not a parenthesis, continue.
   - At index 15, character is ')'. Top of stack is `['(', 12]`, pop it.
   - At index 16, character is 'q'. Not a parenthesis, continue.
   - At index 17, character is ')'. Top of stack is `['(', 10]`, pop it.

3. After traversal, stack contains `[[')', 2], [')', 7]]`.
4. Remove characters at indices 2 and 7 from `s_list`.
5. Resulting string: `"aqxyqf(a(ba)q)"`.

#### Observations
The algorithm incorrectly retains the unmatched `)` at index 6. This happens because the stack only tracks unmatched parentheses but does not account for consecutive unmatched closing parentheses.

#### Fix
Modify the algorithm to ensure unmatched closing parentheses are handled correctly by skipping them during traversal.
