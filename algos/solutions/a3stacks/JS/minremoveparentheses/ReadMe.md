### Dry Run of Failing Test Case (Example 3 - Updated)

#### Input
```
"aq)xy())qf(a(ba)q)"
```

#### Steps
1. Initialize `stack = []` and `s_list = ['a', 'q', ')', 'x', 'y', '(', ')', ')', 'q', 'f', '(', 'a', '(', 'b', 'a', ')', 'q', ')']`.
2. Traverse the string:
   - At index 0, character is 'a'. Not a parenthesis, continue.
   - At index 1, character is 'q'. Not a parenthesis, continue.
   - At index 2, character is ')'. Stack is empty, remove it by setting `s_list[2] = ''`.
   - At index 3, character is 'x'. Not a parenthesis, continue.
   - At index 4, character is 'y'. Not a parenthesis, continue.
   - At index 5, character is '('. Push index 5 to stack.
   - At index 6, character is ')'. Top of stack is 5 (matching '('), pop it.
   - At index 7, character is ')'. Stack is empty, remove it by setting `s_list[7] = ''`.
   - At index 8, character is 'q'. Not a parenthesis, continue.
   - At index 9, character is 'f'. Not a parenthesis, continue.
   - At index 10, character is '('. Push index 10 to stack.
   - At index 11, character is 'a'. Not a parenthesis, continue.
   - At index 12, character is '('. Push index 12 to stack.
   - At index 13, character is 'b'. Not a parenthesis, continue.
   - At index 14, character is 'a'. Not a parenthesis, continue.
   - At index 15, character is ')'. Top of stack is 12 (matching '('), pop it.
   - At index 16, character is 'q'. Not a parenthesis, continue.
   - At index 17, character is ')'. Top of stack is 10 (matching '('), pop it.

3. After traversal, stack is empty.
4. Resulting string: `"aqxyqf(a(ba)q)"`.

#### Observations
The algorithm correctly removes unmatched parentheses at indices 2 and 7. However, it fails to handle consecutive unmatched parentheses properly, leading to incorrect results in other cases.

#### Fix
Refine the algorithm to ensure unmatched parentheses are handled comprehensively, including consecutive and nested cases.
