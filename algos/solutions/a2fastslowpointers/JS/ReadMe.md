# Fast & Slow Pointers

This folder contains implementations of algorithms using the Fast & Slow Pointers technique. Below are the algorithms included and instructions to run them.

## Algorithms

### 1. Happy Number
Determines if a number is a "happy number" by repeatedly summing the squares of its digits until it reaches 1 or enters a loop.

### 2. Circular Array Loop
Detects if a circular array contains a loop where the movement is either all forward or all backward.

### 3. Find Duplicate
Finds a duplicate number in an array using the Fast & Slow Pointers technique.

## Setup

1. Initialize the project:
   ```powershell
   npm init -y
   ```

2. Install Jest for testing:
   ```powershell
   npm install --save-dev jest
   ```

## Running the Code

To run the main demonstration file:
```powershell
npm start
```

## Running Tests

To run the tests:
```powershell
npm test
```

## Folder Structure
- `circulararray/`: Contains the implementation and helper for the Circular Array Loop algorithm.
- `findduplicate/`: Contains the implementation and helper for the Find Duplicate algorithm.
- `happynumber/`: Contains the implementation and helper for the Happy Number algorithm.
